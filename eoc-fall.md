# Description and Goals

We will explore what computer science educators have identified as seven “big ideas” in computing: creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impacts ([AP Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles)). Our major learning objectives for this course include:
- Understand the basic concepts of computers, their components, and operation
- Understand how problems can be approached through computational principles and methods
  * Define common computing and programming terms and concepts.
  * Employ common programming patterns and abstractions to solve problems.
  * Choose appropriate data structures to develop efficient applications.
  * Discuss the trade-offs of different programming strategies and techniques.
  * Trace the execution of programming code, recognize errors, and correct bugs.
  * Construct [Python](http://www.python.org) code to solve problems and automate processes in different domains and disciplines.
- Increase self-efficacy in learning, using, and troubleshooting digital technologies
- Consider digital technologies in context of historical development and social consequence 
- Reflect critically on how the affordances of digital information technologies shape our relationship to our selves, other people, and knowledge 

In this course, we will begin to break into the “black box” of the computer. Computing is more than simply sending email, building webpages, and creating documents. This course  is designed for students without prior programming experience and covers the fundamentals of computational thinking and programming in the Python programming language. 

To be successful in this course you must: tinker, play, build, make, tweak, experiment, hack, and break things. You will push your boundaries and the boundaries of the technology, ask many questions of yourself and your peers, be confused and/or frustrated and/or lost, dig yourself out of those traps and think deeply about the digital tools that are part of digital and computing technology. This course is not about gaining mastery of particular tools, but rather building the skills and experience that will allow you to be comfortable and confident engaging with and evaluating new and familiar technologies.

# Textbook

There are no required texts that must be purchased for this course. All assigned materials are available through Hesburgh Libraries and/or posted as an accessible PDF on Canvas. Links to Hesburgh Library resources are included in the “Course Schedule” of the syllabus and also posted on Canvas. 

A number of additional resources on the Python programming language are available online. These resources are useful for troubleshooting or exploring specific topics more deeply.
- [Link to Google Doc](https://bit.ly/walden-python-resources) with general Python resources

# Technology

This course will use the Canvas learning management system.

We will walk through setting up an account in the Replit IDE when we start working in Python. The instructor will engage in live coding using Replit, but you are welcome to use any Python environment. If you face challenges working with Replit, TAs can help you identify an alternate IDE.

If you do not have access to a personal computer, laptops are available for checkout at the Hesburgh Library’s first floor Circulation Desk (link to more information). You can also reserve a computer station at the Hesburgh Library (link to reservation system).

# Assignments

## Reflections

Each week, you will engage with the assigned material and other course content via individual reflections. These reflections summarize what you have learned and how you learned during the process of engaging with the readings and related work during a given week. The reflection should provide an analysis of the experience drawing upon the course topics, themes, and readings. Someone reading your reflection should have a sense of why this project was significant to your learning, how your understanding of computing has changed (or not), and how the project has impacted your understanding of computing and digital technology.

These reflections could take a variety of forms--written text, recorded audio, video, etc. Length guidelines:
- Written text (at least 300 words in length)
  * OR
- Recorded audio/video (at least 2 minutes)

## Lab Notebooks

Throughout the semester, we will work through a number of lab projects designed to increase your comfort level and proficiency with specific computing concepts. For each lab project, you will be provided with a set of instructions that will guide you through the successful completion of the lab. Your lab notebook will document your experience completing the tutorial including your questions and observations and responses to the discussion questions included in the lab instructions. 

Your notebook should be submitted on Canvas as a single document containing the responses to the discussion questions, your observations and questions, and any additional reflection. **Lab notebooks that do not use the provided notebook template will be marked as incomplete.**

## Final Project

The final project for this course involves a web-scraping project written in Python. Specifically, the final project allows you to select a web page (or web pages) and write a Python program (or programs) that downloads select content from that web page as a plain-text file (`CSV`, `TXT`, etc). That content could be paragraphs of text, tables of data, etc.

Successful final projects will include two main components:
- a well-documented, working Python program written in Jupyter Notebooks
- a written reflection (minimum 300 words) that documents how you approached the final project/what you wanted to accomplish via the final project, resources consulted, how you handled challenges you encountered, key takeaways, etc.
  * That reflection can come at the end of the Jupyter Notebook or be embedded throughout the Jupyter Notebook, if you want to approach authoring the notebook as a type of tutorial or "report".

Expect to spend at least 10 hours working on the final project. That includes brainstorming, meeting with instructor/TAs, in-class work time, etc. If you’re working on a project that is not going to take that much time, think about how to add complexity or take on another smaller scale project.

Contact the instructor with questions.

Our work in the web scraping lab is designed to lay the foundation and serve as a springboard for final project work. Specifically, Q4, Q10, and Q13 ask you to develop an outline for web scraping programs using BeautifulSoup and pd.read_html().  Those questions (and other work for this lab) are the starting place for the final project.

Specifically, think about the kinds of web content you were able to scrape for these questions and how you might further develop, refine, or expand your work.

For example, these questions asked you to develop an outline for specific types of webscraping programs.
- One next step for the final project could be selecting 1-2 of these programs and further developing or refining the code.
- Another next step (especially if you were able to develop working programs for these questions) is to think about how you could expand or extend these workflows to multiple web pages or other web data sources.
- A third option for next steps would involve thinking expansively about how you could apply the concepts and approaches covered in this lab to a different type of data source/structure.

So in the interim, think about where you could go next with expanding and extending your work in this lab, and start to flesh out or develop some of your own ideas about where you put your time and effort as you work on the final project.

## Participation and Engagement

Class sessions will consist of three modes of instruction and participation/engagement. All of these options include synchronous and asynchronous engagement options.

**Lectures** will typically focus on the presentation of a key idea and may include some in-class activities. Lectures will be pre-recorded and posted on Panopto (which you can access through Canvas).

**Discussions** will build on assigned materials and information presented in lectures. These conversations are an opportunity for you to build on individual reflections, engage with colleagues’ observations, and work collaboratively to more fully understand assigned material and core concepts. Discussions will take place synchronously.

These discussions will be framed by questions/prompts provided by your colleagues as well as the instructor. Participation/engagement involves showing up, interacting/engaging with colleagues, and providing well-developed contributions and responses. Discussion engagement/participation options will include a wide variety of formats, including:
- Large group discussions
- Small group discussions
- Individual brainstorming/reflectionollaborative Google Doc annotation
- Etc.

**Labs** will typically focus on working through a series of steps to learn or make use of a particular tool–such as the command line, Python code, or a software designed to demonstrate a particular computing concept. A lab overview and in some cases live coding will be recorded and posted on Panopto (which you can access through Canvas). Participation and engagement involves showing up, working with colleagues as assigned, asking questions as needed, and completing the work of the lab. You may not always complete the lab during class. Be prepared for labs to also require work outside class time. Slack and/or email are available to let you pose questions to colleagues, teaching assistants, and the instructor.

## Assignment Deadlines, Late Work & Extenuating Circumstances

All assignments are due at the date and time listed in the individual assignment descriptions. For assignments without a specific due date/time, they should be submitted in the week listed on the schedule.

In the event we move to remote learning (for a period of time or the remainder of the semester): Posted deadlines reflect whatever time zone is local to where you are (i.e. an assignment due at 5pm on Friday in South Bend would be due 5pm on Friday in your local time zone).

Assignments that are not submitted in a timely fashion will result in an Incomplete assessment. This policy protects both your time and mine. It also ensures that you will remain on track to complete all of your work by the end of the term. I will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances, so please reach out to me if you believe that you cannot meet an assignment deadline.

Complete/Incomplete grades will be posted on Canvas. If you would like to discuss your performance in the course, email me to set up an appointment. I am not able to send or discuss grade information via email. 

It is your responsibility to contact me as soon as possible if such a circumstance will prevent you from attending a class session or completing the coursework according to the set schedule. I will then work with you to determine the best path forward for your particular situation.

# Accessibility and Inclusion

## Privacy

This course is a community built on trust; in order to create the most effective learning experience, our interactions, discussions, and course activities must remain private and free from external intrusion. The hybrid nature of this course means we will be using digital platforms that create additional  As members of this course community, we are obliged to respect the individual dignity of all and to refrain from actions that diminish others’ ability to learn. 
Course materials (videos, assignments, problem sets, etc) stay within the course. If you’re wanting to share them with students outside the course or in a public forum, check with me first.

Some class meetings (when there are lectures) will be recorded to support remote students and to provide everyone in the class with useful study aids. These recordings will be available for review through Canvas. The University strictly prohibits anyone from duplicating, downloading, or sharing live class recordings with anyone outside of this course, for any reason.

Student work, discussion posts, and all other forms of student information (name, email, image, etc.) are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Sharing private information about our course community (including discussions, activities, presentations, student work, etc) with others for the purpose of inviting external attention, intrusion, ridicule, or harassment is an egregious breach of trust.

## Non-Discrimination

My goal is to create a fully inclusive classroom, thus I welcome individual students to approach me about distinctive learning needs. Our work in this class falls under the University’s non-discrimintion policy, which prohibits discrimination “basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or age” ([University of Notre Dame, Office of Institutional Equity, “Notice of Non-Discrimination”](https://equity.nd.edu/equity-resources/notice-of-non-discrimination/))

## Accomodations

In particular, I encourage students with disabilities to have a conversation with me and disclose how our classroom or course activities could impact the disability and what accommodations would be essential.

Any student who has a documented disability and is registered with Accessibility Services should speak with the professor as soon as possible regarding accommodations. Students who are not registered should contact the Sara Bea Center for Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible (https://sarabea.nd.edu/). 

## Mental Health

Care and Wellness Consultants provide support and resources to students who are experiencing stressful or difficult situations that may be interfering with academic progress. Through Care and Wellness Consultants, students can be referred to The University Counseling Center (for cost-free and confidential psychological and psychiatric services from licensed professionals), University Health Services (which provides primary care, psychiatric services, case management, and a pharmacy), and The McDonald Center for Student Well Being (for problems with sleep, stress, and substance use). Visit http://care.nd.edu to learn more.

## Title IX

The University of Notre Dame provides services for those who have been affected by sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating or domestic violence, stalking and any conduct that creates a hostile environment.
