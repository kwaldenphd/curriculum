## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of Christine Darden?
- How do the authors connect Darden's story to the concept of data feminism?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### What "is" data feminism?

“...a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought. The starting point for data feminism is something that goes mostly unacknowledged in data science: power is not distributed equally in the world...The work of data feminism is first to tune into how standard practices in data science serve to reinforce these existing inequalities and second to use data science to challenge and change the distribution of power” (8-9)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Combahee River Collective Statement Collaborative Annotation

- Step #1: Spend 5 minutes working individually to add your questions/comments/notes to the original text using Google Doc’s “comment” feature.
  * What statements or passages stood out to you (and how/why)?
  * What questions do you have? What concepts or terms are not clear?
  * Other comments/questions/observations

- Step #2: Spend 5-7 minutes discussing your observations and questions with a neighbor(s). Take notes in the Google Doc.
  * What are some of the statement’s central arguments? 
  * What connections can we make with the content and concepts covered in the Data Feminism introduction?
  * Other comments/questions/observations

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of Serena Williams?
- How do the authors connect this story (and others in the chapter) to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Examine Power"

Quotes to consider
- “Data feminism begins by analyzing how power operates in the world. This consists of asking who questions about data science: Who does the work (and who is pushed out)? Who benefits (and who is neglected or harmed)? Whose priorities get turned into products (and whose are overlooked)?” (47)
- “How did we get to the point where data science is used almost exclusively in the service of profit (for a few), surveillance (of the minoritized), and efficiency (amidst scarcity)?” (41)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Terminology
Chapter 1 introduces some big concepts and terms from Black feminist theory and intersectional feminist theory.

A few examples:
- Matrix of domination (and four domains)
- Missing data
- Privilege hazard

Questions to consider:
- How do the authors engage these concepts in the chapter we read and reading group video?
- What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?

### On Missing Datasets

- Step #1: Navigate to github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets in a web browser and spend 3-5 minutes individually exploring the GitHub repository.

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * What does Onuoha mean by the concept of “missing” data sets? What do you see in the GitHub repository? How does that connect to the discussion of missing data in Data Feminism?
  * What are some of the reasons behind or for “missing data”- and why does that matter?
    * Or, what could that mean for work we do with data
  * Other questions/observations that you’re having around this concept and project

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

- [Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FudaZX9kVRkC57RLd2jxuDntJVT_r56WIlRqAqSVBAo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Closing Prompt
- Share a project, story, or figure/visual that stood out to you from this chapter? How are you thinking about data (broadly defined) differently after engaging with this chapter?

Quotes to consider
- “Challenging power requires mobilizing data science to push back against existing and unequal power structures and to work toward more just and equitable futures” (53)
- *collect, analyze, imagine, and teach* (53)
- “Shifting the frame from concepts that secure power, like fairness and accountability, to those that challenge power, like equity and co-liberation, can help to ensure that data scientists, designers, and researchers take oppression and inequality as their grounding assumption for creating computational products and systems” (72)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Redlining

- [Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXOqKDH8E6CW11kxIVNQF1QieplhycyLHfkUCfxSL2A/edit?usp=sharing)

### Data Ethics Versus Data Justice

- Step #1: Select a data journalism story or other type of interactive/narrative/visualization.
  * [FiveThirtyEight]()
  * [New York Times’ The Upshot]()
  * [CityLab]()
  * [The Pudding]()
  * [ProPublica]()
  * [The Markup]()

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * What's being communicated and how (data, statistics, visualization choices, etc)
  * Where and how emotion and embodiment show up
    * If they don't show up, what could it look like to consider emotion/embodiment with this data or visualization
  * Other comments/questions/observations, or connections with this week's chapter

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

### Closing Prompt
- Share a project, story, or figure/visual that stood out to you from this chapter? How are you thinking about data (and data communication/visualization) differently after engaging with this chapter?

### Additional Quotes/Resources
#### Deficit narratives/thinking
- “'Deficit thinking' refers to the notion that students (particularly those of low income, racial/ethnic minority background) fail in school because such students and their families have internal defects (deficits) that thwart the learning process (for example, limited educability, unmotivated; inadequate family support). Deficit thinking, an endogenous theory, 'blames the victim' rather than examining how the schools are structured to prevent certain students from learning. As such, the theory contends that poor schooling performance is rooted in the students' alleged cognitive and motivational deficits, whilst institutional structures and inequitable schooling arrangements that exclude students from learning are exculpatory. The authors in this book argue that deficit thinking is a pseudoscience founded on racial and class bias.” 
  * Richard R. Valencia, ed. *The Evolution of Deficit Thinking: Educational Thought and Practice* (Routledge, 1997)

#### Disrupting deficet thinking
- “...deficit thinking is rooted in a blame the victim orientation that suggests that people are responsible for their predicament and fails to acknowledge that they live within coercive systems that cause harm with no accountability...we discuss how deficit thinking is not only a symptom of larger systemic oppression, but also reinforces these oppressive systems. Furthermore, deficit thinking is pervasive and implicit, and often emerging in language that treats people as problems.”
  * Lori Patton Davis and Samuel D. Museus, “[Identifying and Disrupting Deficit Thinking](https://medium.com/national-center-for-institutional-diversity/identifying-and-disrupting-deficit-thinking-cbc6da326995)” *Spark* 19 July 2019

#### Tech/Data Ethics at ND
- “Better detection of faces of color cannot be characterized as an unqualified good. More often than not, it is enlisted in the service of increased oppression, greater surveillance, and targeted violence” (32)
- “While equitable representation--in datasets and data science workforces--is important, it remains window dressing if we don’t also transform the institutions that produce and reproduce those biased outcomes in the first place” (32)

## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of visualizing gun deaths?
- How do the authors connect the story behind this visualization to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions

### This week's principle: "Elevate Emotion and Embodiment"

Quotes to consider
- “Data feminism teaches us to value multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world” (73)
- “[emotion and embodiment] help avoid inadvertently conveying the view from no body: the view from an imaginary and impossible standpoint that does not and cannot exist” (95)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

This week's principle in relation to data visualization...
- "In the case of data visualization, what is excluded is emotion and affect, embodiment and expression, embellishment and decoration. These are aspects of the human experience associated with women, and thus devalued by the logic of our master stereotype” (96)
- “Rebalancing emotion and reason opens up the data communication toolbox and allows us to focus on what truly matters in a design process: honoring context, architecting attention, and taking action to defy stereotypes and reimagine the world” (96)

**How does this approach to data visualization compare to what you've previously encountered? How are you thinking about data communication differently after engaging with this chapter?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Data presentation/communication/visualization
- Partial perspective
- Data-ink ratio (related term: chartjunk)
- Master stereotype
- Framing effects
- Provenance rhetoric
- Situated knowledge
- Standpoint theory
- Positionality
- Affect
- Data visceralization
- God trick
- Reason/emotion dichotomy

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

  * [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)
  * [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/)
  * [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/)
