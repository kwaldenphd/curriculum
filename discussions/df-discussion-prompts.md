## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of Christine Darden?
- How do the authors connect Darden's story to the concept of data feminism?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### What "is" data feminism?

“...a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought. The starting point for data feminism is something that goes mostly unacknowledged in data science: power is not distributed equally in the world...The work of data feminism is first to tune into how standard practices in data science serve to reinforce these existing inequalities and second to use data science to challenge and change the distribution of power” (8-9)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Combahee River Collective Statement Collaborative Annotation

## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of Serena Williams?
- How do the authors connect this story (and others in the chapter) to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Examine Power"

Quotes to consider
- “Data feminism begins by analyzing how power operates in the world. This consists of asking who questions about data science: Who does the work (and who is pushed out)? Who benefits (and who is neglected or harmed)? Whose priorities get turned into products (and whose are overlooked)?” (47)
- “How did we get to the point where data science is used almost exclusively in the service of profit (for a few), surveillance (of the minoritized), and efficiency (amidst scarcity)?” (41)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Terminology
Chapter 1 introduces some big concepts and terms from Black feminist theory and intersectional feminist theory.

A few examples:
- Matrix of domination (and four domains)
- Missing data
- Privilege hazard

Questions to consider:
- How do the authors engage these concepts in the chapter we read and reading group video?
- What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?

### On Missing Datasets

- Step #1: Navigate to github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets in a web browser and spend 3-5 minutes individually exploring the GitHub repository.

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * What does Onuoha mean by the concept of “missing” data sets? What do you see in the GitHub repository? How does that connect to the discussion of missing data in Data Feminism?
  * What are some of the reasons behind or for “missing data”- and why does that matter?
    * Or, what could that mean for work we do with data
  * Other questions/observations that you’re having around this concept and project

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of Gwendolyn Warren and the DGEI map?
- How do the authors connect the story behind the map to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Challenge Power"

Quotes to consider
- “Challenging power requires mobilizing data science to push back against existing and unequal power structures and to work toward more just and equitable futures” (53)
- *collect, analyze, imagine, and teach* (53)
- “Shifting the frame from concepts that secure power, like fairness and accountability, to those that challenge power, like equity and co-liberation, can help to ensure that data scientists, designers, and researchers take oppression and inequality as their grounding assumption for creating computational products and systems” (72)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Redlining
- Racial capitalism
- New Jim Code
- Predictive elements
- Black box
- Auditing algorithms
- Imagined objectivity
- Deficit narratives (sometimes called deficit thinking)
- Imagined objectivity
- Data ethics
- Data justice
- Fairness vs. equity
- Ethics vs. justice
- New racism (Robin DiAngelo, 63)
- Co-liberation

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

- [Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXOqKDH8E6CW11kxIVNQF1QieplhycyLHfkUCfxSL2A/edit?usp=sharing)

### Data Ethics Versus Data Justice

- Step #1: Review the section of this chapter where the authors discuss data ethics versus data justice.

For reference: Table 2.1 (pg. 60) 

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>Concepts That Secure Power <br>(<em>because they locate the source of the problem in individuals or technical systems</em>)</th>
  <th>Concepts That Challenge Power <br>(<em>because they acknowledge structural power differentials and work toward dismantling them</em>)</th>
 </tr>
 <tr><td>Ethics</td><td>Justice</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Bias</td><td>Oppression</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Fairness</td><td>Equity</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Accountability</td><td>Co-liberation</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Transparency</td><td>Reflexivity</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Understanding algorithms</td><td>Understanding history, culture, and context</td></tr>
 </table>

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * What are some of the arguments the authors make about the limitations of (data) ethics? How do they present (data) justice as a more productive alternative?
  * Questions/comments you have about the (data) ethics versus (data) justice argument

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

### Closing Prompt
- Share a project, story, or figure/visual that stood out to you from this chapter? How are you thinking about data (broadly defined) differently after engaging with this chapter?

### Additional Quotes/Resources
#### Deficit narratives/thinking
- “'Deficit thinking' refers to the notion that students (particularly those of low income, racial/ethnic minority background) fail in school because such students and their families have internal defects (deficits) that thwart the learning process (for example, limited educability, unmotivated; inadequate family support). Deficit thinking, an endogenous theory, 'blames the victim' rather than examining how the schools are structured to prevent certain students from learning. As such, the theory contends that poor schooling performance is rooted in the students' alleged cognitive and motivational deficits, whilst institutional structures and inequitable schooling arrangements that exclude students from learning are exculpatory. The authors in this book argue that deficit thinking is a pseudoscience founded on racial and class bias.” 
  * Richard R. Valencia, ed. *The Evolution of Deficit Thinking: Educational Thought and Practice* (Routledge, 1997)

#### Disrupting deficet thinking
- “...deficit thinking is rooted in a blame the victim orientation that suggests that people are responsible for their predicament and fails to acknowledge that they live within coercive systems that cause harm with no accountability...we discuss how deficit thinking is not only a symptom of larger systemic oppression, but also reinforces these oppressive systems. Furthermore, deficit thinking is pervasive and implicit, and often emerging in language that treats people as problems.”
  * Lori Patton Davis and Samuel D. Museus, “[Identifying and Disrupting Deficit Thinking](https://medium.com/national-center-for-institutional-diversity/identifying-and-disrupting-deficit-thinking-cbc6da326995)” *Spark* 19 July 2019

### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of visualizing gun deaths?
- How do the authors connect the story behind this visualization to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Elevate Emotion and Embodiment"

Quotes to consider
- “Data feminism teaches us to value multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world” (73)
- “[emotion and embodiment] help avoid inadvertently conveying the view from no body: the view from an imaginary and impossible standpoint that does not and cannot exist” (95)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

This week's principle in relation to data visualization...
- "In the case of data visualization, what is excluded is emotion and affect, embodiment and expression, embellishment and decoration. These are aspects of the human experience associated with women, and thus devalued by the logic of our master stereotype” (96)
- “Rebalancing emotion and reason opens up the data communication toolbox and allows us to focus on what truly matters in a design process: honoring context, architecting attention, and taking action to defy stereotypes and reimagine the world” (96)

**How does this approach to data visualization compare to what you've previously encountered? How are you thinking about data communication differently after engaging with this chapter?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Data presentation/communication/visualization
- Partial perspective
- Data-ink ratio (related term: chartjunk)
- Master stereotype
- Framing effects
- Provenance rhetoric
- Situated knowledge
- Standpoint theory
- Positionality
- Affect
- Data visceralization
- God trick
- Reason/emotion dichotomy

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

### Exploring Data Journalism

- Step #1: Select a data journalism story or other type of interactive/narrative/visualization.
  * [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
  * [New York Times’ The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)

  * [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)
  * [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/)
  * [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/)

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * What's being communicated and how (data, statistics, visualization choices, etc)
  * Where and how emotion and embodiment show up
    * If they don't show up, what could it look like to consider emotion/embodiment with this data or visualization
  * Other comments/questions/observations, or connections with this week's chapter

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

### Donna Haraway
- Turn to a neighbor(s) and spend a few minutes discussing the Donna Haraway article we read for today.

- How does the article help us better understand the concepts of situated knowledges and partial perspective?
  * When possible, point to a specific quote/passage

- What are some of the characteristics or attributes Haraway uses to describe situated knowledges/partial perspective?
  * Again, when possible, point to a specific quote/passage

- Questions that emerged for you after reading this article?

### Closing Prompt
- Share a project, story, or figure/visual that stood out to you from this chapter? How are you thinking about data (and data communication/visualization) differently after engaging with this chapter?

### This week's principle: "Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies"

Quotes to consider
- “Data feminism requires us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting and classification that perpetuate oppression” (97)

#### ...but this is Notre Dame

From this chapter:
- “Many twentieth-century feminist scholars attempted to address the social construction of gender by treating gender as something separate from sex. But that distinction is increasingly breaking down. Both gender and sex are social constructs” (100)

From "[The Spirit of Inclusion](https://news.nd.edu/news/university-has-published-a-statement-of-inclusion-in-accordance-with-the-teachings-of-jesus-christ/)" (University of Notre Dame, August 1997):
- “We prize the uniqueness of all persons as God’s creatures. We welcome all people, regardless of color, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, social or economic class, and nationality, for example, precisely because of Christ’s calling to treat others as we desire to be treated. We value gay and lesbian members of this community as we value all members of this community. We condemn harassment of any kind, and University policies proscribe it. We consciously create an environment of mutual respect, hospitality and warmth in which none are strangers and all may flourish.”

Prof. Walden's observations...
- Our authors and assigned content for this week make arguments that contradict positions taken by Notre Dame administration and by the Vatican (as well as the religious traditions of some non-Catholic faith communities).
- We don’t have to have this conversation (i.e. this doesn’t have to be a class-wide conversation). I recognize that individual reflection or one-on-one conversation outside class are likely safer spaces to take up these topics, tensions, and related questions.
- My door is open.

Quotes from the chapter to consider:
- “Data feminism requires us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting and classification that perpetuate oppression” (97)
- “Counting and classification can be powerful parts of the process of creating knowledge. But they’re also tools of power in themselves” (122)
  * *counting, sorting, classifying, categorizing, detecting, grouping*
- “An intersectional feminist approach to counting insists that we examine and, if necessary, rethink the assumptions and beliefs behind our classification infrastructure, as well as consistently probe who is doing the counting and whose interests are served” (123)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

This week's principle in relation to data visualization:
- “By challenging the binary thinking that erases the experiences of certain groups while elevating others, we can work toward more just and equitable data practices and consequently toward a more just and equitable future...Sometimes, however, the goal of challenging binary thinking can be constrained by the realities of the field. Visualization designers, for example, do not typically have control over the collection practices of the data they are asked to visualize. They often inherit binary data” (111)

**What solutions or practical strategies do the authors provide for this challenge? How are you thinking about data communication differently after this week’s chapter?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Binaries (also: binary, either/or logic)
- Hierarchy
- Categorization/classification
- Data as “information made tractable” (103)
- Paradox of exposure
- Administrative violence
- Patriarchy
- Gender as a social construct

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

## Discussion Prompts
### Opening Prompt

Grab something to write with and write on.

Spend 5 minutes reflecting individually:
- What stood out to you about the opening story of AEMP (versus Princeton's Eviction Lab)?
- How do the authors connect this story/their analysis/the work of these groups to this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once 5 minutes is up...
- Turn to your neighbor(s) and do a quick round of introductions
- Share observations from your individual reflection

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Embrace Pluralism"

Quotes to consider
- Data feminism insists that the most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives, with priority given to local, Indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing” (125)
- Call to embrace pluralism “all the time and everywhere in the process”
  * *Funding/leadership, research questions, data collection, processing/cleaning, analysis, deployment, visualization/communication*
- “Embracing pluralism...allows both time and space for a range of participants to contribute their knowledge to a data project and to do so at all stages of that project...This means transferring knowledge from experts to communities and explicitly cultivating community solidarity in data work” (147-8)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Pluralism (also: multiple perspectives)
- Tidy data
- Data cleaning
- Occlusion
- Data scientists as unicorns/wizards/ninjas/rock stars/janitors (133)
- Epistemic violence (133, 147)
- Reflexivity
- Transparency
- Co-liberation (from Chapter 2)

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

### Data Cleaning and Tidy Data

The authors talk about tidy data and the tidyverse at length in the “Strangers in the Dataset” section of the chapter (130-137), to ask a few central questions.
- How can we ask “who” questions of tidy data values/processes?
- How do we reckon with the epistemic violence inherent in statistics as a discipline?

**What else stood out to you in the authors’ discussion of tidy data and the history of statistics?**

### Data for Good Versus Data for Co-Liberation

- Step #1: Review the section of this chapter where the authors discuss data ethics versus data justice.

For reference: [Table 5.1](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/2wu7aft8#nobxi408tlj)

<table>
<tr>
 <th colspan="3">Table 5.1: Features of "data for good" versus data for co-liberation</th></tr>
 <tr><th></th><th>"Data for good"</th><th>Data for co-liberation</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Leadership by members of minoritized groups working in community</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Money and resources managed by members of minoritized groups</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Data owned and governed by the community</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Quantitative data analysis “ground truthed” through a participatory, community-centered data analysis process</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Data scientists are not rock stars and wizards, but rather facilitators and guides</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Data education and knowledge transfer are part of the project design</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Building social infrastructure—community solidarity and shared understanding—is part of the project design</td><td></td><td>√</td></tr>
</table>
 
- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * How is your thinking changing in relation to this distinction (and metrics/evaluation criteria)?
  * What are some concrete ways to put these principles in action?

- Step #3: Share observations with the larger group.

### Closing Prompt

- What stood out to you about the opening story of the GDELT data and the FiveThirtyEight visualization?
- What connections can we make with this week's principle and data feminism more broadly?

Once another 5 minutes is up, we'll reconvene and folks can share observations with the larger group.

### This week's principle: "Consider Context"

Quotes to consider:
- “Data feminism asserts that data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis” (149)
- “The bottom line for numbers is that they cannot speak for themselves. In fact, those of us who work with data must actively prevent numbers from speaking for themselves because...they run the risk not only of being arrogantly grandiose and empirically wrong, but also of doing real harm in their reinforcement of an unjust status quo” (171)
- “Until we fund context, then excellent contextual work will remain the exception rather than the norm” (172)

**What did you find most interesting or surprising about this definition or framing? What else would you add?**

Communicating context and data visualization:
- “It’s not just in the stages of data acquisition or data analysis that context matters. Context also comes into play in the framing and communication of results” (164)
- “This counsel--to name racism, sexism, or other forces of oppression when they are clearly present in the numbers--particularly applies to designers and data scientists from the dominant group with respect to the issue at hand” (167)

**How does this approach to data visualization compare to what you've previously encountered? How are you thinking about data communication differently after engaging with this chapter?**

### Terminology
A few core concepts from this chapter:
- Big Dick Data (151)
- Knowledge infrastructure (153)
- Open data (155)
- Zombie data (155)
- Reporting bias (157-159)
- “‘Raw data’ is an oxymoron” (159, quoting Gitelman/Jackson)
- Subjugated knowledge (163)

**What concepts and terms did you have questions about? What wasn't clear? What else should be on this list?**

- [Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PfwDuvV4BitdaH-C51EPcDEEIRwSunK6rwQpOKOipjc/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Big Dick Data

<figure><img src="http://datafeminism.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Data-feminism-06-B.png"><figcaption>“Big Dick Data is a formal, academic term that denotes big data projects that are characterized by masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture and analysis. Bick Dick Data projects ignore context, fetishize size, and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities” (151)</figcaption></figure>

### Open Data Movement (challenges and aspirations)

- [Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PfwDuvV4BitdaH-C51EPcDEEIRwSunK6rwQpOKOipjc/edit?usp=sharing)

- Step #1: Select one of the open data resources linked below. Explore the general interface, and identify/select/search for a specific dataset.
  * [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  * [South Bend Open Data Portal](https://data-southbend.opendata.arcgis.com/)
  * [OpenICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)

  * [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
  * [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
  * [Documenting the Now Twitter Catalog](https://catalog.docnow.io/)

- Step #2: Group up with the folks around you and spend 5-7 minutes discuss/take notes on the following questions:
  * Discuss what context is provided (and what is missing)?
    * Related question from check-in surveys: how can open data best be used to provide enough context to the public, but at the same time, protect the identity of those in the documents?

- Step #3: For the platform and dataset you explored, what could it look like to restore context?
  * The authors provide a few examples of efforts to put data in context:
    * Data user guides (Bob Gradek)
    * Data biographies (Heather Krause)
    * Detailed codebooks (Valerie Hudson & WomanStats.org)
    * Datasheets for datasets (Timnit Gebru et al.)
    * Model cards for model reporting (Margaret Mitchell et al.)

- Step #4: Share observations with the larger group.

### Algorithms of Oppression

Turn to a neighbor (or neighbors).

Spend a few minutes discussing...
- What stood out to you from Noble’s discussion of Google search results and white supremacist ideologies?
- How do the arguments Noble makes about Google search connect to data feminism?
- Theories/concepts/frameworks that cross over
- Other connections you’re making

Once another 5 minutes is up, share observations with the larger group

### This week's principle: "Make Labor Visible"

Quotes to consider:
- “It’s not a coincidence that much of the work that goes into designing a data product--visualization, algorithm, model, app--remains invisible and uncredited” (178)
- “In addition to the invisible labor of data work, there is also labor that remains hidden because we are not trained to think of it as labor at all. This is what is known as emotional labor” (192)
- “An emphasis on labor opens the door to the interdisciplinary area of data production studies: taking a data visualization, model, or product and tracing it back to its material conditions and contexts, as well as to the quality and character of the work and people required to make it” (200-201)
- “Showing the work is crucial to ensure that undervalued and invisible labor receives the credit it deserves, as well as to understand the true cost and planetary consequences of data work” (201)

![Reading group sketch notes from this session](http://datafeminism.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Data-feminism-07.png)
