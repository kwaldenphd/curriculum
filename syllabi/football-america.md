Football is one of the most enduringly popular and significant cultural activities in the United States. Since the late 19th century, football has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand "America." And Notre Dame football plays a central role in that story, with larger-than-life figures and stories, from Knute Rockne’s “Win one for the Gipper” line to the “Four Horsemen” backfield that led the program to a second national championship in 1924. The mythic proportions of the University’s football program cast a long shadow on the institution’s history, cultural significance, and traditions. This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football’s past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working with digitized materials to think about questions relating to access and discovery of physical and electronic collections. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship.

Through this course, you will be able to:
- Identify and describe key developments, structures, and stakeholders in U.S. and Notre Dame football history
- Describe and explain various aspects of U.S. football as an industry and cultural practice
- Evaluate primary source materials relating to Notre Dame and U.S. football
- Design and construct research projects that connect American Studies interdisciplinary frameworks and digital historical methods to course topics and content
- Gain self-efficacy in working with digital history tools and methods
- Undertake collaborative work that builds project management skills

# Assignments

## Reflections

Each week, you will engage with the assigned material and other course content via individual reflections. These reflections summarize what you have learned and how you learned during the process of engaging with the readings and related work during a given week. The reflection should provide an analysis of the experience drawing upon the course topics, themes, and readings. Someone reading your reflection should have a sense of why this project was significant to your learning, how your understanding of computing has changed (or not), and how the project has impacted your understanding of computing and digital technology.

These reflections could take a variety of forms--written text, recorded audio, video, etc. Length guidelines:
- Written text (at least 400 words in length)
  * OR
- Recorded audio/video (at least 3 minutes)

## Labs

During the first ten weeks of the course, we will engage in three projects that will employ digital history methods to interact with and interrogate primary sources and archival material related to Notre Dame football. Work for each lab will start with collaborative in-class brainstorming and work time. You should plan for these projects to also require work outside class time. Successfully completing these assignments will involve both individual and collaborative work. 

### Lab #1: Textual Analysis

This lab will use textual analysis methods to explore student newspaper coverage of Notre Dame football. The project will include opportunities to work with computer vision methods (optical character recognition) and exploratory textual analysis/visualization (using coding and no-coding tools/methods). This lab will focus on methods for working with unstructured text. 

- [Link to lab procedure](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-text-analysis) (GitHub)

### Lab #2: Primary Sources as Structured Data

This lab will involve using data analysis and visualization methods to interact with digitized football-related material from the University Archives as structured data. The project will include opportunities to develop a data model/structure, use manual or computational methods to map information from primary sources to a data structure, and conduct exploratory data analysis/visualization (using coding and no-coding tools/methods). This lab will focus on methods for working with structured data.

- [Link to lab procedure](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-structured-data) (GitHub)

### Lab #3: Digital Exhibits

This lab will involve working with digital archive and exhibit platforms and tools to think about avenues for presenting or sharing historical work. Specifically, it focuses on workflows for building out item-level metadata needed to generate a robust digital archive/exhibit and prototyping options for sharing or presenting that work using digital exhibits and interactive digital storytelling tools. 

This lab provides a few different types of open-ended opportunities for thinking about how to share/communicate/present information related to primary source materials, in a smaller-scale, lower-stakes setting than the final project. I encourage folks to approach this lab as a pilot or “proof of concept” for work they might want to continue or develop further in the final project.

- [Link to lab procedure](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits) (GitHub)

## Final Project

The final project for this course is an open-ended creation that engages topics, concepts, and other course elements. One of my goals for the final project is for you to have an opportunity to delve into and explore in greater depth an aspect of the course that interests you, while also having the opportunity to further develop skills you would like to hone.

You can undertake this project individually or in a group.

I will generally be open to final project ideas with a strong rationale and feasibility plan. Final projects do not have to include an applied digital history component. But all projects, regardless of topic and method, are expected to incorporate critical interdisciplinary perspectives grounded in American Studies--that includes consideration of historical, cultural, and social context; identity; power; etc.

The wide range of project options makes it hard to have a single overarching criteria in terms of project length/scope. So we’ll approach this in terms of the number of hours you should expect to spend working on the final project. 

Expect to spend at least 25 hours working on the final project. That includes brainstorming, meeting with instructor/colleagues, case study work (if applicable), in-class work time, etc. If you’re working on a project that is not going to take that much time, think about how to add complexity or take on another smaller scale project.

Contact the instructor with questions.

Things to consider when weighing final project options:
- Skills you bring to this course
- Who the project is “for,” or who you might want to be in conversation with
- What you might want or need to do with the project
- What projects are feasible given social distancing restrictions and other limits on access to campus spaces/resources
- This includes thinking about what resources you would still be able to access in the event of disruption

We will move toward the final project in stages:
- Introduction + Brainstorming
- Proposal
- In-class work time
- Project plan and status update 
- Final Project Share Outs + Submission

## Participation and Engagement

Class sessions will consist of three modes of instruction and participation/engagement. All of these options include synchronous and asynchronous engagement options.

**Lectures** will typically focus on the presentation of a key idea and may include some in-class activities. Synchronous engagement is ideal and involves listening, taking notes, asking questions, and participating fully in activities. Lectures will be recorded and posted on Canvas. 

**Discussions** will build on assigned materials and information presented in lectures. These conversations are an opportunity for you to build on individual reflections, engage with colleagues’ observations, and work collaboratively to more fully understand assigned material and core concepts. Discussions will take place synchronously.

These discussions will be framed by questions/prompts provided by your colleagues as well as the instructor. Participation/engagement involves showing up, interacting/engaging with colleagues, and providing well-developed contributions and responses. Discussion engagement/participation options will include a wide variety of formats, including:
- Large group discussions
- Small group discussions
- Individual brainstorming/reflection
- Collaborative Google Doc annotation
- Etc.

**Labs** will typically focus on working through a series of steps to learn or make use of a particular tool–such as the command line, Python code, or a software designed to demonstrate a particular computing concept. A lab overview and in some cases live coding will be recorded and posted on Panopto (which you can access through Canvas). Participation and engagement involves showing up, working with colleagues as assigned, asking questions as needed, and completing the work of the lab. You may not always complete the lab during class. Be prepared for labs to also require work outside class time. Slack and/or email are available to let you pose questions to colleagues, teaching assistants, and the instructor.

## Assignment Deadlines, Late Work & Extenuating Circumstances

All assignments are due at the date and time listed in the individual assignment descriptions. For assignments without a specific due date/time, they should be submitted in the week listed on the schedule.

In the event we move to remote learning (for a period of time or the remainder of the semester): Posted deadlines reflect whatever time zone is local to where you are (i.e. an assignment due at 5pm on Friday in South Bend would be due 5pm on Friday in your local time zone).

Assignments that are not submitted in a timely fashion will result in an Incomplete assessment. This policy protects both your time and mine. It also ensures that you will remain on track to complete all of your work by the end of the term. I will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances, so please reach out to me if you believe that you cannot meet an assignment deadline.

Complete/Incomplete grades will be posted on Canvas. If you would like to discuss your performance in the course, email me to set up an appointment. I am not able to send or discuss grade information via email. 

It is your responsibility to contact me as soon as possible if such a circumstance will prevent you from attending a class session or completing the coursework according to the set schedule. I will then work with you to determine the best path forward for your particular situation.

# Accessibility and Inclusion

## Privacy

This course is a community built on trust; in order to create the most effective learning experience, our interactions, discussions, and course activities must remain private and free from external intrusion. The hybrid nature of this course means we will be using digital platforms that create additional  As members of this course community, we are obliged to respect the individual dignity of all and to refrain from actions that diminish others’ ability to learn. 
Course materials (videos, assignments, problem sets, etc) stay within the course. If you’re wanting to share them with students outside the course or in a public forum, check with me first.

Some class meetings (when there are lectures) will be recorded to support remote students and to provide everyone in the class with useful study aids. These recordings will be available for review through Canvas. The University strictly prohibits anyone from duplicating, downloading, or sharing live class recordings with anyone outside of this course, for any reason.

Student work, discussion posts, and all other forms of student information (name, email, image, etc.) are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Sharing private information about our course community (including discussions, activities, presentations, student work, etc) with others for the purpose of inviting external attention, intrusion, ridicule, or harassment is an egregious breach of trust.

## Non-Discrimination

My goal is to create a fully inclusive classroom, thus I welcome individual students to approach me about distinctive learning needs. Our work in this class falls under the University’s non-discrimintion policy, which prohibits discrimination “basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or age” ([University of Notre Dame, Office of Institutional Equity, “Notice of Non-Discrimination”](https://equity.nd.edu/equity-resources/notice-of-non-discrimination/))

## Accomodations

In particular, I encourage students with disabilities to have a conversation with me and disclose how our classroom or course activities could impact the disability and what accommodations would be essential.

Any student who has a documented disability and is registered with Accessibility Services should speak with the professor as soon as possible regarding accommodations. Students who are not registered should contact the Sara Bea Center for Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible (https://sarabea.nd.edu/). 

## Mental Health

Care and Wellness Consultants provide support and resources to students who are experiencing stressful or difficult situations that may be interfering with academic progress. Through Care and Wellness Consultants, students can be referred to The University Counseling Center (for cost-free and confidential psychological and psychiatric services from licensed professionals), University Health Services (which provides primary care, psychiatric services, case management, and a pharmacy), and The McDonald Center for Student Well Being (for problems with sleep, stress, and substance use). Visit http://care.nd.edu to learn more.

## Title IX

The University of Notre Dame provides services for those who have been affected by sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating or domestic violence, stalking and any conduct that creates a hostile environment.
