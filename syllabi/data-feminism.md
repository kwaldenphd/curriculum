Feminism isn't only about women, nor is feminism only for women. Feminism is about power - about who has it and who doesn't. And in today's world, data is power. Data can be used to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But data can also be used to discriminate, marginalize, and surveil. This course will draw intersectional feminist theory and activism to identify models for challenging existing power differentials in data science, with the aim of using data science methods and tools to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data science tools and methods (such as Tableau, RStudio, and Python). This course will also examine the data advocacy and activism work undertaken by groups like Our Data Bodies, Data for Black Lives, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Chicago-based Citizens Police Data Project. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that use data to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice. This course is not about gaining mastery of particular data science tools or methods, therefore familiarity with statistical analysis or data science tools (R, RStudio, Python, etc.) is NOT a prerequisite for this course. 

Through this course, you will be able to:
- Identify and describe the relationship between intersectional feminism and data-driven technology systems
- Evaluate and critique data-driven technology systems and research projects through the lens of interdisciplinary American Studies and Data Feminism frameworks
- Gain self-efficacy in working with structured data and related data science tools
- Design and construct research projects that connect American Studies and Data Feminism interdisciplinary frameworks to course topics and content
- Undertake collaborative work that builds project management skills

# Assignments

## Reflections

Each week, you will engage with the assigned material and other course content via individual reflections. These reflections summarize what you have learned and how you learned during the process of engaging with the readings and related work during a given week. The reflection should provide an analysis of the experience drawing upon the course topics, themes, and readings. Someone reading your reflection should have a sense of why this project was significant to your learning, how your understanding of computing has changed (or not), and how the project has impacted your understanding of computing and digital technology.

These reflections could take a variety of forms--written text, recorded audio, video, etc. Length guidelines:
- Written text (at least 400 words in length)
  * OR
- Recorded audio/video (at least 3 minutes)

## Lab Notebooks

In the first ten weeks of the semester, we work through a number of lab projects designed to increase your comfort level and proficiency with using R/RStudio, an open-source program widely used in data science work. For each lab project, you will be provided with a set of instructions that will guide you through the successful completion of the lab. Your lab notebook will document your experience completing the tutorial including your questions and observations and responses to the discussion questions included in the lab instructions. 

Your notebook should be submitted on Canvas as a single document containing the responses to the discussion questions, your observations and questions, and any additional reflection. Include your name and lab title on the first page. 

For weeks that have a lab assignment, we will spend time in class on Thursday introducing the lab and working on it collaboratively. 

## Final Project

The final project for this course involves an open-ended creation that uses data feminism philosophies and approaches to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice. There is no one specific form this project must take. One of my goals for the final project is for you to have an opportunity to delve into and explore in greater depth an aspect of the course that interests you, while also having the opportunity to further develop skills you would like to hone.

You can undertake this project individually or in a group.

Projects that could fulfill this assignment might include:
- Analyze or audit an algorithm, like ProPublica journalists did in their 2016 “Machine Bias” project
  * “[Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)” (23 May 2016)
  * “[How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm)” (23 May 2016)
- Draft a policy or advocacy report/whitepaper document, possibly modeled on the type of reports generated by the ACLU
  * [Racial Justice](https://www.aclu.org/search/%20?f%5B0%5D=type%3Aasset&f%5B1%5D=field_asset_type%3Areport&f%5B2%5D=field_issues%3A239)
  * [Privacy & Technology](https://www.aclu.org/search/%20?f%5B0%5D=type%3Aasset&f%5B1%5D=field_asset_type%3Areport&f%5B2%5D=field_issues%3A98)
- Build a public-facing interactive resource built using RStudio and Shiny (or another data science tool). Possible models include….
  * [Chicago Citizens Police Data Project](https://beta.cpdp.co/)
  * [Torn Apart / Separados ](http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/1/)
  * [Hack Oregon Demo Day projects](https://civicplatform.org/cards)
- A podcast, video, or other type of multimedia/digital project that applies course concepts and interdisciplinary frameworks
- Some type of creative work (musical performance, dance, short story, piece of art, etc.) that connects to the work of this course

I will generally be open to final project ideas with a strong rationale and feasibility plan.

The wide range of project options makes it hard to have a single overarching criteria in terms of project length/scope. So we’ll approach this in terms of the number of hours you should expect to spend working on the final project.

Expect to spend at least 20 hours working on the final project. That includes brainstorming, meeting with instructor/colleagues, public contribution to knowledge project work, in-class work time, etc. If you’re working on a project that is not going to take that much time, think about how to add complexity or take on another smaller scale project.

Contact the instructor with questions.

Things to consider when weighing final project options:
- Skills you bring to this course
- Who the project is “for,” or who you might want to be in conversation with
- What you might want or need to do with the project
- What projects are feasible given social distancing restrictions and other limits on access to campus spaces/resources
- This includes thinking about what resources you would still be able to access in the event of disruption

We will move toward the final project in stages:
- Introduction + Brainstorming
- Proposal
- In-class work time
- Project plan and status update 
- Final Project Share Outs + Submission

## Participation and Engagement

Class sessions will consist of three modes of instruction and participation/engagement. All of these options include synchronous and asynchronous engagement options.

**Lectures** will typically focus on the presentation of a key idea, historical moment, or set of concepts. Lectures are pre-recorded and made available to all members of the class. These videos will be part of the “Assigned Material” for each wee (posted on Panopto which you can access through Canvas).

**Discussions** will build on assigned materials and information presented in lectures. These conversations are an opportunity for you to build on individual reflections, engage with colleagues’ observations, and work collaboratively to more fully understand assigned material and core concepts. Discussions will take place synchronously.

These discussions will be framed by questions/prompts provided by your colleagues as well as the instructor. Participation/engagement involves showing up, interacting/engaging with colleagues, and providing well-developed contributions and responses. Discussion engagement/participation options will include a wide variety of formats, including:
- Large group discussions
- Small group discussions
- Individual brainstorming/reflection
- Collaborative Google Doc annotation
- Etc.

**Labs** will typically focus on working through a series of steps to learn or make use of a particular tool–such as the command line, Python code, or a software designed to demonstrate a particular computing concept. A lab overview and in some cases live coding will be recorded and posted on Panopto (which you can access through Canvas). Participation and engagement involves showing up, working with colleagues as assigned, asking questions as needed, and completing the work of the lab. You may not always complete the lab during class. Be prepared for labs to also require work outside class time. Slack and/or email are available to let you pose questions to colleagues, teaching assistants, and the instructor.

## Assignment Deadlines, Late Work & Extenuating Circumstances

All assignments are due at the date and time listed in the individual assignment descriptions. For assignments without a specific due date/time, they should be submitted in the week listed on the schedule.

In the event we move to remote learning (for a period of time or the remainder of the semester): Posted deadlines reflect whatever time zone is local to where you are (i.e. an assignment due at 5pm on Friday in South Bend would be due 5pm on Friday in your local time zone).

Assignments that are not submitted in a timely fashion will result in an Incomplete assessment. This policy protects both your time and mine. It also ensures that you will remain on track to complete all of your work by the end of the term. I will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances, so please reach out to me if you believe that you cannot meet an assignment deadline.

Complete/Incomplete grades will be posted on Canvas. If you would like to discuss your performance in the course, email me to set up an appointment. I am not able to send or discuss grade information via email. 

It is your responsibility to contact me as soon as possible if such a circumstance will prevent you from attending a class session or completing the coursework according to the set schedule. I will then work with you to determine the best path forward for your particular situation.

# Accessibility and Inclusion

## Privacy

This course is a community built on trust; in order to create the most effective learning experience, our interactions, discussions, and course activities must remain private and free from external intrusion. The hybrid nature of this course means we will be using digital platforms that create additional  As members of this course community, we are obliged to respect the individual dignity of all and to refrain from actions that diminish others’ ability to learn. 
Course materials (videos, assignments, problem sets, etc) stay within the course. If you’re wanting to share them with students outside the course or in a public forum, check with me first.

Some class meetings (when there are lectures) will be recorded to support remote students and to provide everyone in the class with useful study aids. These recordings will be available for review through Canvas. The University strictly prohibits anyone from duplicating, downloading, or sharing live class recordings with anyone outside of this course, for any reason.

Student work, discussion posts, and all other forms of student information (name, email, image, etc.) are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Sharing private information about our course community (including discussions, activities, presentations, student work, etc) with others for the purpose of inviting external attention, intrusion, ridicule, or harassment is an egregious breach of trust.

## Non-Discrimination

My goal is to create a fully inclusive classroom, thus I welcome individual students to approach me about distinctive learning needs. Our work in this class falls under the University’s non-discrimintion policy, which prohibits discrimination “basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or age” ([University of Notre Dame, Office of Institutional Equity, “Notice of Non-Discrimination”](https://equity.nd.edu/equity-resources/notice-of-non-discrimination/))

## Accomodations

In particular, I encourage students with disabilities to have a conversation with me and disclose how our classroom or course activities could impact the disability and what accommodations would be essential.

Any student who has a documented disability and is registered with Accessibility Services should speak with the professor as soon as possible regarding accommodations. Students who are not registered should contact the Sara Bea Center for Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible (https://sarabea.nd.edu/). 

## Mental Health

Care and Wellness Consultants provide support and resources to students who are experiencing stressful or difficult situations that may be interfering with academic progress. Through Care and Wellness Consultants, students can be referred to The University Counseling Center (for cost-free and confidential psychological and psychiatric services from licensed professionals), University Health Services (which provides primary care, psychiatric services, case management, and a pharmacy), and The McDonald Center for Student Well Being (for problems with sleep, stress, and substance use). Visit http://care.nd.edu to learn more.

## Title IX

The University of Notre Dame provides services for those who have been affected by sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating or domestic violence, stalking and any conduct that creates a hostile environment.  For help and further information including contact information for on and off-campus resources, consult titleix.nd.edu/support-resources.
